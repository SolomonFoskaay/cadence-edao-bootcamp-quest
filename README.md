# ANSWERS TO QUESTS

## CHAPTER 1

### DAY 1
You are free to answer these questions in your own language of choice. And no, I don't mean computer programming language, haha.

#### QUESTION 1: 
Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp
#### ANSWER: 
Blockchain is a decentralized database that allows storage and retrieval of data.

#### QUESTION 2: 
Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts
#### ANSWER: 
Smart Contract is a piece of code that run in a Blockchain

#### QUESTION 3: 
Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
#### ANSWER:
A Script is use to access information from the Blockchain. It's free.
A Transaction involves making changes and storing information into the Blockchain. It's not free and requires paying transaction/gas fees.


### DAY 2
#### QUESTION 1: 
What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
#### ANSWER: 
Cadence pillars are
1. Security - ensuring smart contract are secure by design (and cheap to deploy on Flow Blockchain too)
2. clarity - easy to read even for non-coder
3. Approachability - seemilar to existing programming languages to make it easier to learn if have experience with any programming language
4. Debug: Easy to debug error
5. Resource Oriented Programming Language

#### QUESTION 2: 
In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
#### ANSWER: 
The 5 pillars could be very useful to make Flow Blockchain attractive to developers and enhance them to build scalable dApps due to cheap deployment fees.
Low subsequent transaction fees for developers and their users to interact with the smart contract after deployment will aid mass adoption of the Blockchain and web3 as a whole
