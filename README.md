What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
Answer: Cadence pillars are
1. Security - ensuring smart contract are secure by design
2. clarity - easy to read even for non-coder
3. Approachability - seemilar to existing programming languages to make it easier to learn if have experience with any programming language
4. Debug: Easy to debug error
5. Resource Oriented Programming Language

In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
So,
